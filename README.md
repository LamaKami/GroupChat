# GroupChat
simple terminal group chat

Start both services in different terminals with:
```
cargo run
```

When you want to run the server on a different device like a rasp pi in your network, you have to change the address in the client to the ip from the rasp pi.
e.g.
```localhost -> 196.0.0.3```
